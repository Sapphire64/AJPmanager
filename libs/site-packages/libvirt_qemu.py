    This API will attach to an externally launched QEMU process
    identified by @pid. There are several requirements to successfully
    attach to an external QEMU process:
    
      - It must have been started with a monitor socket using the UNIX
        domain socket protocol.
      - No device hotplug/unplug, or other configuration changes can
        have been made via the monitor since it started.
      - The '-name' and '-uuid' arguments should have been set (not
        mandatory, but strongly recommended)
    
    To date, the only platforms we know of where pid_t is larger than
    unsigned int (64-bit Windows) also lack UNIX sockets, so the choice
    of @pid_value as an unsigned int should not present any difficulties.
    
    If successful, then the guest will appear in the list of running
    domains for this connection, and other APIs should operate
    normally (provided the above requirements were honored). """
